 abstract = {We present here an online platform for sharing resources underlying publications in neuroscience. It enables authors to easily upload and distribute digital resources, such as data, code, and notebooks, in a structured and systematic way. Interactivity is a prominent feature of the Live Papers, with features to download, visualise or simulate data, models and results presented in the corresponding publications. The resources are hosted on reliable data storage servers to ensure long term availability and easy accessibility. All data are managed via the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph, thereby helping maintain data provenance, and enabling tight integration with tools and services offered under the EBRAINS ecosystem.},
