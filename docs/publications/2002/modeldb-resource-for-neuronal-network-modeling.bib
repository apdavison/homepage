 abstract = {ModelDB is an online database (<a href="http://senselab.med.yale.edu/senselab/ModelDB">senselab.med.yale.edu/senselab/ModelDB</a>) of published neuronal models, including models of ion channels, dendrites, axons, neurons, synapses and networks of neurons. Having ready access to the code for a model facilitates testing and verification of a model, re-use of model components to speed development of new models, and comparing a model to new experimental data. The database is useful for archiving models and for collaboration on modeling projects, and is a resource for teachers and students in both theoretical and experimental neuroscience. We describe here how to use the database: how to find specific models, how to obtain model code, how to run models, and how to contribute a model to the database,},
