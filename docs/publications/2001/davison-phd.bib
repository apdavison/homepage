 abstract = {The aim of this dissertation is to investigate the processing of sensory signals in the mammalian olfactory bulb, using analysis and computer simulation of mathematical models. A biologically-detailed mathematical model provides a framework which integrates the results of experiments at different levels of enquiry, and enables study of problems which cannot easily be addressed using only the methods of experimental neuroscience.
Specific biological and computational problems which are addressed include: the existence, origin and role of oscillations/synchronisation; how the properties of individual cells/synapses influence the network behaviour; the role of lateral inhibition; how the connectivity between cells influences network behaviour.
The dissertation has four main parts: (i) a review of the anatomy and physiology of vertebrate olfactory systems, and of previous modelling studies of the olfactory bulb; (ii) development of biophysical models of the principal neurone types of the olfactory bulb, based closely on experimental data, but simple enough to allow simulation of large networks; (iii) an examination of the fundamental interaction in the bulb -- that between two mitral cells -- using simulation of the biophysical cell models and analysis of the simpler integrate-and-fire neurone model; (iv) development of network models of the olfactory bulb incorporating the biophysical neurone models. These are tested using experimental data from the literature, and then the properties of the network are studied, leading to predictions which could be tested experimentally.},
