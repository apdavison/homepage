 abstract = {As computational neuroscience matures, many simulation environments are available
that are useful for neuronal network modeling. However, methods for successfully
documenting models for publication and for exchanging models and model components
among these projects are still under development. Here we briefly review existing
software and applications for network model creation, documentation and exchange.
Then we discuss a few of the larger issues facing the field of computational
neuroscience regarding network modeling and suggest solutions to some of these
problems, concentrating in particular on standardized network model terminology, notation, and descriptions and explicit documentation of model scaling. We hope this will
enable and encourage computational neuroscientists to share their models more
systematically in the future.},
