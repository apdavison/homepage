 abstract = {Author summary Neuroscience is experiencing a rapid growth of data streams characterizing composition, connectivity, and activity of brain networks in ever increasing details. Data-driven modeling will be essential to integrate these multimodal and complex data into predictive simulations to advance our understanding of brain function and mechanisms. To enable efficient development and sharing of such large-scale models utilizing diverse data types, we have developed the Scalable Open Network Architecture TemplAte (SONATA) data format. The format represents neuronal circuits and simulation inputs and outputs via standardized files and provides much flexibility for adding new conventions or extensions. SONATA is already supported by several popular tools for model building, simulations, and visualization. It is free and open for everyone to use and build upon and will enable increased efficiency, reproducibility, and scientific exchange in the community.},
