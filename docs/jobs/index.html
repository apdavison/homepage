<h3>About us</h3>
<p>UNIC (Unité de Neurosciences, Information et Complexité; <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unic.cnrs-gif.fr/">http://www.unic.cnrs-gif.fr/</a>) is a research unit of the CNRS, located on a parkland campus in Gif-sur-Yvette, about 40 minutes from central Paris. UNIC consists of seven research groups, with a shared focus on complexity in the dynamics of neocortical networks during sensory processing and perception, and using a range of experimental, theoretical and informatics approaches.</p>
<p>The Neuroinformatics research group within UNIC pursues an open-science, data-driven approach to studying computational function in sensory systems, making use of large-scale modelling and simulation. We develop and share software and methodologies for databasing and sharing of neuroscience data, for efficient and reproducible model specification, simulation and validation, and for enhancing the reproducibility of computational research. We aim to provide a supportive and welcoming environment.</p>
<p>The group is a core member of the Human Brain Project (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/">https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/</a>), a European Flagship initiative in which over 100 partners will work together to build a completely new information computing technology infrastructure for neuroscience and for brain-related research in medicine and computing, catalysing a global collaborative effort to understand the human brain and its diseases and ultimately to emulate its computational capabilities.</p>
