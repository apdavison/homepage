        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p class="large">
          Sharing scientific data is not an end in itself; the value of shared data is only realised when those data are
          reused, whether to validate publications, test new hypotheses, build computational models, or conduct
          meta-analyses. However, “reuse” is perhaps the most challenging of the FAIR principles to achieve. One of the
          main reasons for this is the need to fully understand how the data were produced: for example, the details of
          the experimental preparation, the recording conditions, and any stimulation or behavioural protocols used.
        </p>
        <p class="large">
          Many scientific data repositories provide only minimal metadata, insufficient for easily reusing the data. The
          EBRAINS data repository provides basic metadata for all datasets, using the openMINDS metadata framework,
          including properties of individual experimental subjects and samples. For a subset of EBRAINS datasets,
          curators
          have gone further, annotating datasets with extended, in-depth metadata including rich information about data
          files, recording setups, and stimuli.
        </p>
        <p class="large">
          Taking a number of these datasets as case studies, we have developed Jupyter notebooks showing how to reuse
          the data, focusing on recreating published figures. For each dataset we wrote one notebook based on the
          dataset after basic curation, and another notebook making use of the additional metadata available after
          extended curation.
          By comparing the “before” and “after” versions we aim to demonstrate the value and the limitations
          of in-depth metadata for facilitating data reuse.

        <h2>The EBRAINS Data Repository</h2>
        <p class="large">
          <a href="https://ebrains.eu">EBRAINS</a> is a digital research infrastructure for neuroscience,
          building on the legacy of the <a href="https://www.humanbrainproject.eu">EU Human Brain Project</a>.
          One part of this infrastructure is a data repository, which hosts neuroscience datasets alongside other
          research products such as models and software.
        </p>
        <p class="large">All EBRAINS datasets go through a manual curation process, to ensure they have adequate and
          accurate metadata. Dataset providers are required to provide a detailed data descriptor giving details of the
          dataset structure, the file formats used, and how the data were acquired.</p>
        <p class="large">Metadata are stored in the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph (KG).
          Data files are stored at partnering European supercomputer centres, or in certain approved external
          repositories, with only the metadata stored in the KG.</p>
        <p class="large">The KG has different user interfaces, including a search UI (see screenshot below) and a REST
          API.
          Software development kits are available for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript and Java.

        <p class="large">In the case studies we examined, some of the uses of metadata were:</p>

        <ul class="large">
          <li>locating data for download</li>
          <li>quickly viewing descriptions/annotations <i>in situ</i> (e.g., in a Jupyter notebook), without having to
            switch
            to a different window (e.g., web browser)</li>
          <li>applying corrections/offsets to raw data (e.g., liquid junction potential)</li>
          <li>obtaining units for measured/recorded quantities and for stimulus parameters, allowing quick and
            guaranteed-correct unit conversions</li>
          <li>verifying that units and other metadata stored within data files have been correctly read (important when
            using different software from that used by the dataset providers)</li>
          <li>automatically reconstructing stimuli for use in data analysis</li>
          <li>unambiguous linkage between individual recordings and the specific experimental conditions used for each
            recording</li>
          <li>automatically partitioning of datasets by experimental variables</li>
          <li>partitioning of continuous recordings by experimental/stimulation conditions.</li>

        <h2>Perspectives</h2>
        <p class="large">
          In the datasets studied so far, the structure of the data was fairly simple.
          We next plan to look next at datasets with more complex structures, where the availability of detailed
          metadata
          may be more critical to a successful reanalysis. We will also investigate the use of metadata for
          parameterizing
          standardized data analysis methods for datasets with similar structures.
          In all our case studies, the most critical
          missing information was the details of the data analysis methods used in the papers, underscoring the
          importance
          of sharing data analysis code alongside the data.
