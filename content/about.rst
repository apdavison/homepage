This is the personal website of Andrew Davison. I am a senior research scientist in the
`Department of Integrative and Computational Neuroscience`_ (ICN),
`Paris-Saclay Institute of Neuroscience`_ (CNRS_/Université Paris-Saclay),
where I lead the `Neuroinformatics group`_. You might also be interested
in my `lab homepage`_ or my `Twitter feed`_. My ORCID identifier is `0000-0002-4793-7541`_.

My main research interests are in large-scale, data-constrained, biologically-detailed modelling of neuronal
networks. My work at the moment has several strands:

- development of tools to facilitate collaborative modelling, model sharing, systematic model validation,
  and the use of novel hardware (GPU, neuromorphic) for neuronal simulations, notably PyNN_, NineML_ and NeuroML_.
- promoting reproducible research in computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics, both through trying to
  spread best practices and through tool development (see the Sumatra_ project).
- promoting neurophysiology data sharing, by participation in `international standardisation efforts`_,
  by development of tools to harmonize the handling of electrophysiology data in Python (see the Neo_ project),
  and by development of a framework to simplify databasing of neurophysiology data in small labs,
  part of the `HBP Knowledge Graph`_.
- development of `models of the early visual system`_, from retina to primary visual cortex, in close collaboration
  with experimentalists.

Much of this work is tied together by the `Human Brain Project`_ and through the `NeuralEnsemble`_ community.
