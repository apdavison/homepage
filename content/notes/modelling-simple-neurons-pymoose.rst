MOOSE_ (Multiscale Object-oriented Simulation Environment) is a modelling
framework for biological and neuronal networks, developed in `Upinder Bhalla`_'s
lab_ at the NCBS_ in Bangalore. In terms of concepts and goals,
it is a descendant of the GENESIS_ 2 simulator (another descendant being GENESIS 3).

What I find interesting about MOOSE is the wide range of biological scales that
can be modelled, from biochemical signalling pathways up to large-scale neuronal
networks, and the possibility of combining these in a single, multiscale model.

MOOSE comes with a graphical interface, but what I find most interesting is its
Python interface, developed by Subhasis Ray. PyMOOSE is described in an
`article in Frontiers in Neuroinformatics`_, which gives a good ideas of the
capabilities of MOOSE, but does not explain how to use it. The documentation_
for PyMOOSE has improved rapidly of late, but is still far from comprehensive.

This post will give a brief introduction to using PyMOOSE for modelling
small networks of integrate-and-fire neurons, for people who have no previous
experience of using GENESIS. I made these notes for my own benefit, but they
may be useful to others.

MOOSE can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/moose/files/moose/
in various formats. I used the Debian package moose-beta-1.3.0-python26.i386.deb,
which installed without problems.

Let's start by creating a single-compartment neuron:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import moose
    >>> soma = moose.Compartment("soma")
    
MOOSE uses plain SI units, so to make my life easier I'll define some scale
factors:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> mV = 1e-3
    >>> nF = 1e-9
    >>> uS = 1e-6
    >>> ms = 1e-3
    >>> soma.initVm = -65*mV
    >>> soma.Rm = 1/(0.01*uS)
    >>> soma.Cm = 0.2*nF
    >>> soma.Em = -65*mV
    
MOOSE uses different clocks to control the simulation. We will use clock 0 for
integration of the differential equations and clock 1 to control initialization:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> ctx = moose.PyMooseBase.getContext()
    >>> ctx.setClock(0, 0.025*ms, 0) 
    >>> ctx.setClock(1, 0.025*ms, 1)

    >>> soma.useClock(0)
    >>> soma.useClock(1, "init")  
    
Now we have a passive compartment with no ion channels. Let's inject some current
and record the membrane potential to be sure everything is working as we expect.
For recording, we use a ``Table`` object:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> vm_table = moose.Table("Vm")
    >>> vm_table.stepMode = 3
    >>> vm_table.connect("inputRequest", soma, "Vm")
    >>> ctx.setClock(2, 0.1*ms, 0)
    >>> vm_table.useClock(2)

Note that we are recording with a larger time step than that used for integration.

Our membrane leak conductance is 0.01 ÂµS, so an injected current of 0.1 nA should
give us a depolarization of 10 mV:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> nA = 1e-9
    >>> soma.inject = 0.1*nA
    
Now we run the simulation:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> ctx.reset()
    >>> ctx.step(200*ms)

and plot the results:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import numpy, pylab
    >>> v = numpy.array(vm_table)/mV
    >>> t = 0.1*numpy.arange(0, v.size)
    >>> pylab.plot(t, v)
    >>> pylab.xlabel("Time (ms)")
    >>> pylab.ylabel("Membrane potential (mV)")

Next, we will create some ion channels:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> na = moose.HHChannel("na")
    >>> na.Ek = 40*mV
    >>> na.Gbar = 20*uS
    >>> na.Xpower = 3
    >>> na.Ypower = 1
    >>> na.setupAlpha("X", 3.2e5 * -50*mV, -3.2e5, -1, 50*mV, -4*mV, # alpha
                          -2.8e5 * -23*mV,  2.8e5, -1, 23*mV,  5*mV) # beta
    >>> na.setupAlpha("Y", 128,                 0,  0, 46*mV, 18*mV, # alpha
                           4.0e3,               0,  1, 23*mV, -5*mV) # beta
                   
    >>> k = moose.HHChannel("k")
    >>> k.Ek = -90*mV
    >>> k.Gbar = 6*uS
    >>> k.Xpower = 4
    >>> k.setupAlpha("X", 3.2e4 * -48*mV, -3.2e4, -1, 48*mV, -5*mV,
                          500,                 0,  0, 53*mV,  40*mV)
                  
And connect them to the soma:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> soma.connect("channel", na, "channel")
    >>> soma.connect("channel", k , "channel")

Running and plotting again:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> ctx.reset()
    >>> ctx.step(200*ms)
    >>> pylab.figure(2)
    >>> pylab.plot(t, numpy.array(vm_table)/mV)
    >>> pylab.xlabel("Time (ms)")
    >>> pylab.ylabel("Membrane potential (mV)")

.. image:: /figures/active_membrane.png
   :align: center
   :height: 400px
   :alt: Membrane potential of an active compartment with current injection 0.1 nA


Finally, let's replace the current injection by synaptic input:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> soma.inject = 0
    >>> synapse = moose.SynChan("excitatory")
    >>> synapse.Ek = 0*mV
    >>> synapse.tau1 = 0.001*ms
    >>> synapse.tau2 = 2*ms
    >>> synapse.Gbar = 0.01*uS
    >>> soma.connect("channel", synapse, "channel")

To test the synapse we'll use a Poisson spike source:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> spike_source = moose.RandomSpike("input")
    >>> spike_source.minAmp = 1.0
    >>> spike_source.maxAmp = 1.0
    >>> s = 1.0
    >>> spike_source.rate = 100/s
    >>> spike_source.reset = True
    >>> spike_source.resetValue = 0.0

and create a synaptic connection:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> spike_source.connect('event', synapse, 'synapse')
    >>> synapse.setWeight(0, 1.0)
    
As well as recording the membrane potential, we'd like to record the spike times.
Again we use a ``Table``, but this time using ``stepMode = 4``, which detects
the spikes based on threshold crossing:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> spike_tables = {}
    >>> for label in "input", "output":
    ...     table = moose.Table("%s_spikes" % label)
    ...     table.stepMode = 4
    ...     table.stepSize = 1.0*mV  # threshold
    ...     table.useClock(0)
    ...     spike_tables[label] = table
    
    >>> soma.connect('Vm', spike_tables['output'], 'inputRequest')
    >>> spike_source.connect('state', spike_tables['input'], 'inputRequest')

Running the simulation:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> ctx.reset()
    >>> ctx.step(200*ms)
    >>> pylab.figure(3)
    >>> pylab.plot(t, numpy.array(vm_table)/mV)
    >>> pylab.xlabel("Time (ms)")
    >>> pylab.ylabel("Membrane potential (mV)")
    
.. image:: /figures/synaptic_input.png
   :align: center
   :height: 400px
   :alt: Membrane potential of an active compartment with noisy synaptic input

We can now print the spike times:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> for label in "input", "output":
    ...     print label, numpy.array(spike_tables[label])/ms
    input [  13.6     22.575   30.425   39.35    72.55    75.825   79.075   91.775
       98.675   99.2    102.15   118.425  125.625  142.     143.675  144.45
      156.475  165.65   178.     178.925  179.75   189.5    192.925    0.   ]
    output [  25.375   78.45   102.625  144.2    171.2    192.05     0.   ]
 
I'm not sure why there is an extraneous "0." at the end, but this can easily
be discarded.

This post has only scratched the surface of MOOSE. I will post more notes as I
explore further.
