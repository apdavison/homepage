At the `CNS 2012`_ meeting in Decatur, Georgia, I gave a tutorial on reproducible research, focusing on computational neuroscience. The tutorial covered best practices for writing code to facilitate reproducibility, version control systems, testing, and provenance tracking.

Notes for the tutorial are online at http://rrcns.readthedocs.org/en/cns2012/
