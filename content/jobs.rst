Position available: research software engineer
==============================================


A scientific programmer/software engineer position is available in the UNIC laboratory of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), to work on open source software and web applications for data-driven neuroscience. This work will form part of the European Human Brain Project.
If you are passionate about science, and wish to use your software development skills to push forwards the boundaries of neuroscience in an open, collaborative project, please consider applying!

The position is available immediately on a fixed-term contract ending 31st March 2018, possibility of renewal. Salary depends on experience, and will be on the standard French research scale (24 000 € - 30 000 € per annum)


Qualifications
--------------

You should be proficient in:

    - Python programming
    - modern development methods, including version control, code review, continuous integration
    - producing code that is efficient, clear, documented and tested

with good communication skills, the ability to drive projects forward autonomously but also to be an effective team member.

Preference will be given to candidates who also have experience with:

    - modern front-end web development (Javascript, Angular, HTML, CSS)
    - the Django web framework
    - cloud deployment of web applications, Docker

Knowledge of French would be helpful but is not required, as English is the working language.


Location
--------

Gif-sur-Yvette (91), Ile-de-France, France


Mission
-------

As part of a small team, you will participate in:

- development, testing, and optimisation of existing software for neuronal network simulation, scientific data sharing, data analysis, and reproducible research
- conception, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of web services for neuromorphic computing, model validation, and data sharing
- international collaboration to develop standards for data-driven neuroscience modelling

The position will involve some international travel within Europe.

How to apply
------------

Send your CV, a letter of motivation and contact information for two references to Dr Andrew Davison (andrew.davison@unic.cnrs-gif.fr). Informal inquiries are also welcome.


About us
--------

UNIC (Unité de Neurosciences, Information et Complexité; http://www.unic.cnrs-gif.fr/) is a research unit of the CNRS, located on a parkland campus in Gif-sur-Yvette, about 40 minutes from central Paris. UNIC consists of seven research groups, with a shared focus on complexity in the dynamics of neocortical networks during sensory processing and perception, and using a range of experimental, theoretical and informatics approaches.

The Neuroinformatics research group within UNIC pursues an open-science, data-driven approach to studying computational function in sensory systems, making use of large-scale modelling and simulation. We develop and share software and methodologies for databasing and sharing of neuroscience data, for efficient and reproducible model specification, simulation and validation, and for enhancing the reproducibility of computational research. We aim to provide a supportive and welcoming environment.

The group is a core member of the Human Brain Project (https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/), a European Flagship initiative in which over 100 partners will work together to build a completely new information computing technology infrastructure for neuroscience and for brain-related research in medicine and computing, catalysing a global collaborative effort to understand the human brain and its diseases and ultimately to emulate its computational capabilities.
